## Python for Cybersecurity

### Key Topics:
- **Scripting and Automation**: Automate penetration testing, exploit development, and incident response procedures.
- **Web Application Testing**: Scraping and testing websites with Python libraries such as`requests`,`BeautifulSoup`, and`Selenium`.
- **Exploitation**: Use Python to construct custom exploits and payloads for web and network vulnerabilities.

- **Cryptography**: Learn encryption techniques using Python libraries like `PyCrypto` and `cryptography`.
- **Network security**: Libraries like`socket`,`scapy`, and `asyncio` are useful for network scanning, fuzzing, and packet manipulation.

## Practical Applications: Use `nmap` and `os-fingerprint` to automate network scans.
- Creating custom Python-based reverse shells and exploits.
- Creating bespoke vulnerability scanners.

## Bash for Security Automation

### Key Topics:
- **System Administration & Penetration Testing**: Automate daily security checks and penetration tests.
- **File System Security**: Automated file integrity checks, secure file transfer, and permission management.
- **Shell Scripting for Attack**: Create Bash scripts for exploits such as command injection, privilege escalation, and persistence.
- **Network Tools in Bash**: Use Bash tools such as `netcat`, `nc`, `tcpdump`, and `nmap` to execute network security testing.

## Practical Applications: - Create Bash scripts for automated exploitation in CTF or real-world settings.
- Creating a persistent  backdoor with Bash.
- Create payloads for reverse shells.

## Regular Expressions in Security

### Key Topics:
- **Pattern Matching in Security**: The use of regular expressions to detect patterns in logs, network traffic, and user input.
- **Data Exfiltration**: Detecting suspicious data exfiltration or malicious command patterns with regex.
- **Log Analysis**: Using regular expressions to analyze logs for attack vectors such as SQL injection, XSS, and RCE.
- **Regex in Web Application Security**: Validating input to protect against injection threats and cross-site scripting.

### Practical Applications: - Detecting dangerous URLs in logs.
- Finding and exploiting regex weaknesses in programs.
- Using regex to find personally identifiable information (PII) in text.

## Go for Secure Applications

### Key Topics:
- **Go for Secure Coding**: Secure application development and code auditing using Go.
- **Concurrency and Parallelism**: Understanding Go`s concurrency mechanism (goroutines) to create high-performance security tools.
- **Network Security**: Developing bespoke network utilities for penetration testing, such as port scanners and packet sniffers.

- **Go Exploit Development**: Create Go-based exploits, payloads, and reverse shells.

### Useful Applications: 
- Developing a bespoke port scanner with Go.
- Creating a Go-based listener to handle reverse shells.
- Creating secure Go apps by leveraging Go`s memory safety mechanisms.
